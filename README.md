# Generating-Primary-Ovarian-Culture
This file contains how you can generate a primary ovarian cell culture from human tissue. 
AIM : cell harvesting from ovarian tumor tissue
Materials : Ovarian tissue samples, sterile blade, cell scraper steril, 1X Ice-Cold PBS, OSE Medium, FBS, Pen-Strep, Gentamicin, Amphotericin b, 60mm cell culture dish, 37C degree incubator.
Protocol :
For cell harvesting from tumor tissue, an optimized protocol will be used in our laboratory based on protocols published in the literature (Brigitte et al, 2013; Pribly et al, 2014). 
- In brief, the tissue sample delivered to the cell culture laboratory in culture medium at +4°C is washed with sterile cold PBS and blood tissue and cells are removed as much as possible. 
- It is placed in 60mm diameter cell culture dishes containing OSE medium (Wisent Bioproducts, 316-030-CL) specific for ovarian cancer cells pre-warmed to 37°C. 
- They are grasped with sterile forceps and cut approximately 2x2x2mm with a sterile scalpel. 
- The cut tissues are gently scraped with a sterile cell scraper so that the cells fall into the culture medium.
- The tissue and the cells to be separated from the tissue are incubated overnight with OSE culture medium. 
- At the end of the first 24 hours, the cells adhere to the culture plate. At the end of 24 hours, the medium containing the remaining tissue fragments and erythrocytes is removed and fresh medium is added to the culture plate. 
- Cultured cells are kept under constant observation.
- After 48 hours, fresh medium is added to the culture medium. Cells reach 60% occupancy between 4-7 days depending on tissue size (Figure 1).
